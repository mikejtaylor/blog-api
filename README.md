# blog-api

This is a simple blog api built using NodeJS & Express with a Postgres database. Sequelize has also been integrated as the ORM.

It is relatively trivial and still needs lot of improvement. The purpose was to get familiar with Sequelize and certainly is not expected to be a production ready API
